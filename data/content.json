  "about": "I build systems because I'm genuinely obsessed with how computers work.\n\nMy work focuses on agentic AI systems - not wrappers, but the underlying orchestration, control loops, and world models that make intelligent behavior possible. I'm particularly interested in embodied agents and high-leverage workflows that turn models into real systems.\n\nI've been drawn to AI since middle school, but my curiosity goes deeper than models. In my free time, you'll usually find me in Wong Avery Library booting a simulated IBM-7094, experimenting with ELIZA, or learning COBOL for no practical reason."
