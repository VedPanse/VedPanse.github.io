  "about": "I build mobile and desktop applications that combine thoughtful design with strong engineering, and I specialize in AI systems—especially multimodal, agentic models that can reason, act, and adapt. My work sits at the intersection of app development, applied research, and real-world products, turning advanced ideas into software people actually use. I care deeply about building systems that are scalable, intuitive, and genuinely push technology forward."
