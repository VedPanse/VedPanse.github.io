# From ideas to real products

![Notes from building systems that have to work in the real world](assets/banners/intro.png)

Hi. I’m Ved.

I’m a student at UC San Diego. I study computer science and data science, but what I really like is building things and then watching them break in ways I did not predict.

I’m interested in systems that have to deal with real constraints — speed, memory, users clicking the wrong button, hardware doing something weird, or code that works perfectly until it suddenly doesn’t. I enjoy the part where an idea stops sounding smart and starts demanding actual effort.

Most of my time is split between classes, hackathons, research, startups, and side projects that probably started as “small ideas.” I like developer tools, aviation systems, and anything that sits awkwardly between software and the real world. If something has edge cases, tradeoffs, or the potential to fail quietly at 2 a.m., I tend to gravitate toward it.

I also travel more than I expect to. Projects and competitions have a way of putting me in new cities, new rooms, and conversations that make me realize how much I still don’t know. Those moments are exciting and slightly uncomfortable, which usually means they’re worth writing about.

This blog is where I keep notes. Not tutorials, not announcements, and definitely not a highlight reel. Just thoughts from building things, fixing them, breaking them again, and slowly getting better at it.

I don’t have a grand plan for this blog. I’m just writing as I go. If you’re into building, learning the hard way, and watching ideas turn into real products, you might enjoy it here.
