# The time I met the CIA Director in shorts

![Me in Washington D.C., blissfully unaware of the dress code](assets/blog/uscc/cia.jpg)

So I went to Washington D.C. for the United States Cybersecurity Challenge.

Which already sounds fake when I say it out loud.

For context: I had somehow placed first internationally in the competition, which meant I got flown out to D.C. to meet a lot of very serious people who care about cybersecurity in a very serious way. This is the part of the story where you’d expect me to say I packed carefully and behaved like a responsible adult.

You would be wrong.

The day itself felt surreal. Briefings. Technical conversations. People discussing national-scale systems like they were normal Tuesday problems. I was trying very hard to look like I belonged and not like someone who still googles “what is threat modeling” five minutes before meetings.

Then came dinner.

Nobody told me it was formal.

And when I say nobody told me, I mean I had fully convinced myself this was going to be a “casual networking dinner.” You know. Polite. Maybe business casual. Something survivable.

I showed up in shorts.

Not cool minimalist European shorts. Not “intentionally rebellious tech founder” shorts. Just regular, this-is-what-I-packed-because-I-assumed-we-were-eating-pizza shorts.

I walked into the room and immediately realized two things:

1. Everyone else looked ironed.
2. I did not.

And then someone casually mentioned that the Director of the CIA was there.

There is a very specific moment when your brain replays the last six hours of your life and asks, “Was there a branch where we made better decisions?”

I considered leaving. I considered hiding behind a decorative plant. I considered inventing a fictional ankle injury that required ventilation.

Instead, I stayed.

And here’s the strange part: once the initial panic faded, it was… normal. People were talking about systems. Risk. Infrastructure. Security at scale. The conversation wasn’t theatrical. It wasn’t cinematic. It was thoughtful and technical and grounded.

Underneath the titles and the security clearances, it was still just people who think deeply about how things break — and how to prevent that.

Which, honestly, is my favorite genre of conversation.

I flew back from D.C. thinking about two things:

First: always ask about the dress code.

Second: competence travels better than outfits. Placing first internationally felt huge at the time, but sitting in that room, what mattered wasn’t the ranking. It was whether you could engage seriously with the problems being discussed. Titles fade fast. Preparation doesn’t.

(That said, I now own at least one pair of formal pants.)

USCC was surreal. Not because of the ranking or the location, but because it was the first time cybersecurity felt heavy in a real way. Not puzzles. Not competitions. Infrastructure. Responsibility. Consequences.

And apparently, dress codes.

(# of times I will double-check “formal” in the future: many)
