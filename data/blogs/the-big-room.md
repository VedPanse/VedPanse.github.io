# I met the CIA Director in shorts

![A cool room](assets/blog/uscc/hero.jpg)

So I placed first internationally at the United States Cybersecurity Challenge.

Which sounds impressive until you remember I also once forgot my laptop charger at a hackathon and had to sit next to a wall like a plant.

Anyway.

They flew me to Washington D.C. I’m feeling important. I’m like, “Wow. Cybersecurity. National stuff. I should probably stand straighter.” Everyone’s wearing badges. People are speaking in calm, low tones. The kind of tone where you assume they know things you absolutely do not.

The day goes well. Briefings. Conversations. I nod like I fully understand everything. Internally I’m thinking, “Okay yes yes adversarial models yes infrastructure yes I totally knew that.”

Then comes dinner.

Nobody tells me it’s formal.

Now when I pack for trips, I pack based on vibes. And the vibe in my head was “technical event.” Technical events mean hoodie. Technical events mean comfortable. Technical events do NOT mean pressed slacks and polished shoes.

So I show up in shorts.

Just regular shorts. Not cool shorts. Not ironic shorts. Just “this man thought this was casual” shorts.

I walk into the room.

Everyone looks like they were assembled by a committee.

Blazers. Dresses. Shoes that make confident sounds on the floor.

And I’m standing there with my knees out.

That’s when someone casually mentions, “Oh yeah, the Director of the CIA is here.”

You ever feel your soul leave your body but politely?

I considered turning around. I considered pretending I was staff. I considered starting a small fire alarm incident so everyone evacuates and no one notices my legs.

But no.

I stayed.

And here’s the weird part: once I got past the fact that my calves were visible in a federal building, the conversations were just… conversations. People talking about systems. Real systems. Infrastructure. Risk. The kind of stuff where if you mess up, it’s not a bug report — it’s a headline.

And I realized something.

Nobody cared that I was in shorts.

Okay, maybe they noticed.

But what mattered was whether I could hold a conversation. Whether I understood the material. Whether I could think clearly about security at scale.

Ranking first internationally got me on the plane.

Knowing what I was talking about kept me in the room.

Still. I now own formal pants.

I even tried them on once.

USCC was wild. Not because of the titles. Not because of D.C. But because it was the first time cybersecurity stopped feeling like puzzles and started feeling heavy. Like real-world heavy.

Also because I learned that “formal dinner” is not a metaphor.

(# of times I will now ask about dress code: aggressively many)
