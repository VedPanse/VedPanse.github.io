# The room felt bigger than the competition

The United States Cybersecurity Challenge was one of the most demanding competitions I've ever prepared for. It wasn't about speed alone, and it wasn't about trick questions. It tested whether you could think clearly about systems under pressure — how attacks actually unfold, how defenses fail, and how small decisions cascade into real consequences.

The challenges spanned offensive and defensive security, system design, and deep technical reasoning. You weren't rewarded for memorizing tools. You were rewarded for understanding fundamentals: how systems behave, where assumptions break, and how to reason through incomplete information. It was exhausting in the best possible way.

When the results came out and I learned that I had placed **#1 internationally**, the feeling was hard to describe. It was validating, but also strangely quiet. The competition itself had been so consuming that the ranking felt less like a finish line and more like the end of a long stretch of focus.

What I didn't expect was how little the ranking would end up mattering compared to what followed.

As part of USCC, I was invited to attend ACT-IAC, where I found myself in rooms I had never imagined being in so early. The conversations there were nothing like a competition. I met senior security leaders, including a **Chief Information Security Officer**, the **Director of the CIA**, and several **retired top officials from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security**.

The tone was completely different.

No one cared about puzzles or rankings. They talked about systems that had failed in the field. About decisions that couldn't be rolled back. About security tradeoffs that affected real people, real infrastructure, and real trust. The questions were broader, slower, and heavier. There were no clean answers — only judgment calls made under uncertainty.

I remember listening more than I spoke. Not because I had nothing to say, but because it was clear that this was a different level of work. The room felt bigger than the competition that had brought me there.

That experience changed how I think about building and security. Competitions test whether you can be precise under pressure. These rooms tested whether you could be responsible under ambiguity. Whether you understood not just how systems break, but what happens *after* they break — who's affected, how recovery works, and how trust is rebuilt.

USCC mattered. It pushed me technically and validated the work I had been doing. But ACT-IAC mattered more. It showed me the context around the work — the long timelines, the institutional constraints, and the weight behind decisions that don't show up in problem statements.

I left with a deeper sense of what I want to work on. Not isolated wins, but systems that last. Not just correctness, but resilience. Not just clever solutions, but decisions that hold up when the stakes are real.

The competition ended. The scoreboard disappeared. The work, I realized, was only beginning.
