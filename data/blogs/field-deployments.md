# From prototype to pilot: lessons from field deployments

Taking a prototype into the real world teaches you more in a week than a month of internal testing. These are the lessons we learned on the ground.

## The three surprises

1. **Edge cases are the norm.** Real environments are messy and delightful.
2. **Training matters.** The best product still needs onboarding.
3. **Offline-first wins.** Networks fail more than you think.

## A lightweight checklist

- Field test the full workflow end to end.
- Bring spare hardware and redundant power.
- Capture feedback *in the moment*.

## Closing thought

Shipping is a conversation. Pilots are where the product earns trust.
