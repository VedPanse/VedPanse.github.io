title: I booted an IBM 7094 and ran ELIZA
excerpt: I spent my weekend getting yelled at by a 1960s mainframe simulator until it finally ran a therapist program.

# I booted an IBM 7094 and ran ELIZA

This weekend I found a simulator for the IBM 7094 and immediately decided that this was how I wanted to spend my time. The IBM 7094 is a mainframe from the 1960s, which means it was once the size of a room, required actual operators, and probably made a lot of intimidating mechanical noises. Now it runs in a browser tab, which feels slightly disrespectful to history.

I was originally just reading about early AI programs and ended up learning about ELIZA, which is basically a therapist that rephrases whatever you say and turns it into a question. That’s the whole idea. You type something mildly dramatic like “I feel confused,” and it responds with “WHY DO YOU FEEL CONFUSED?” and apparently that was revolutionary at the time. I wanted to run ELIZA the way it originally ran, not some modern reimplementation that hides everything under a clean interface.

This is how I ended up staring at something called CTSS, which looks less like software and more like instructions for launching a satellite.

Getting the system to boot properly was not smooth. The simulator expects you to know what you’re doing, and I absolutely did not. Every command had to be exact, and if you made a mistake it would respond in aggressive all caps. At one point it told me there was an “ILLEGAL CHARACTER ON CARD,” which is impressive considering I do not possess cards and was typing on a keyboard like a normal person in 2019.

But once I stopped guessing and actually started reading the documentation (which felt very official and slightly judgmental), things started working. Eventually ELIZA loaded, and I typed something in just to confirm it wasn’t broken. It responded immediately, mechanically, and completely without understanding—just pure pattern matching. No learning. No hidden layers. Just structured rules and substitutions.

There was no illusion of intelligence. You could see the machinery behind the curtain. Input goes in, pattern matches, response comes out. It felt clean and strangely satisfying. Modern systems tend to hide everything behind friendly design and abstraction, but this felt direct, almost stubborn.

It’s also strange to think that something that once required an entire room of hardware is now running quietly in a browser window while I sit at my desk. The scale difference is absurd. The personality difference is even better.

The IBM 7094 does not try to make you comfortable. It does not autocomplete. It does not apologize. It simply informs you when you are wrong, loudly and in capital letters.

I respect that.
