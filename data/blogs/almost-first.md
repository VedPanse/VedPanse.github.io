# Almost first, exactly right

There's a moment in every hackathon when you stop thinking in features and start thinking in hours.

Not “what should we build?” but “what can still exist by morning?”

HackPrinceton had that moment early for us.

The idea we arrived with didn't survive intact. It bent. It shed parts. Some things we were proud of never made it past the whiteboard. Others only existed because we ran out of time to doubt them.

By the end, we placed **second overall**.

That result stayed with me longer than a win would have.

Not because second hurts — but because it refuses to resolve itself.

Winning gives you closure. Losing gives you an explanation. Second place just sits there, asking you to keep thinking.

I remember the last few hours clearly. Four of us standing too close to one screen, rereading the same lines of code, not because we didn't understand them — but because we didn't trust them yet. No one was talking much. Not out of stress. Out of focus.

Time felt physical.

At some point, I realized the hardest part wasn't building. It was choosing. Choosing to stop refining. Choosing to leave something imperfect. Choosing not to chase the idea we *wished* we had time for.

Those choices felt small in the moment. They were probably the most important ones we made.

When the results came in, I didn't feel disappointment. I felt clarity.

Second place forces you to look at your decisions without the comfort of celebration. You replay moments you normally forget. You notice where confidence arrived late, or where caution arrived too early. You feel the shape of the work more honestly.

On the train back, I kept thinking about tempo.

Not speed — tempo.

When to explore.
When to commit.
When to stop touching something before you make it worse.

That's not a hackathon lesson. It's a building lesson.

HackPrinceton reminded me that progress isn't always loud. Sometimes it's just a quieter understanding of how you move through uncertainty — with other people, under time, with incomplete information.

We didn't miss first place.

We found something more useful.

A better sense of rhythm.
