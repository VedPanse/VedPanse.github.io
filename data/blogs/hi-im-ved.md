# Hi, I'm Ved.

![Notes from building systems that have to work in the real world](assets/banners/intro.png)

Hi! I’m Ved — a math–computer science and data science student at UC San Diego who was born in the U.S. but mostly grew up in India. If that sounds like two very different operating systems, it kind of is.

I picked up a cricket bat around the same time I figured out how walking worked. I’m still not sure which came first. A lot of my childhood was split between dusty cricket grounds, noisy family gatherings, and the slow realization that I really liked understanding how things worked — not just *that* they worked. At some point that curiosity shifted from “why does this ball swing?” to “why did this program just crash?”

Now I spend most of my time somewhere between proofs, code, and systems that refuse to behave politely. I like building things that have constraints — memory ceilings, latency budgets, hardware quirks, users who click the wrong button. I’ve worked on aviation software, agent systems with memory, and tools that sit awkwardly between software and the physical world. If something works perfectly on a whiteboard but starts wobbling in production, that’s usually where I lean in.

Outside of that, I have a tendency to fall into rabbit holes. I’ve booted an IBM-7094 simulator just to run ELIZA. I’ve tried learning COBOL for no strategic reason. I’ve rewritten code that technically worked because it felt structurally dishonest. None of this is efficient. All of it makes sense in my head.

This blog is where I write about building things, breaking them, and occasionally understanding them. It will probably oscillate between technical deep dives and whatever I’m currently overthinking.

This bio will almost certainly be rewritten at some point when I reread it and decide I sounded either too serious or not serious enough. That’s fine.
