![Notes from building systems that have to work in the real world](assets/banners/intro.png)

Hi.

I’m Ved. I study math–computer science and data science at UC San Diego, which is the formal way of saying I spend a lot of time staring at code, proofs, and diagrams that looked much cleaner before I tried to make them real.

If you’ve met me before, it might have been because I was talking about synthetic vision in aviation, overthinking agent memory architectures, or arguing that determinism is more interesting than “AI magic.” If you haven’t, that’s fine too — this is mostly a notebook that happens to be public.

I like systems that stop cooperating the second you assume they will. Rendering pipelines that jitter under load. Models that forget the one thing they shouldn’t. Hardware that behaves differently than the spec sheet implied. That moment where something technically works but doesn’t feel trustworthy — that’s usually where I get invested.

Outside of actual obligations, I tend to fall into slightly unnecessary rabbit holes. I’ve booted an IBM-7094 simulator just to run ELIZA. I’ve tried learning COBOL for no strategic reason. I’ve rewritten parts of projects that were technically fine but structurally wrong. None of this is efficient. It is, however, satisfying.

This blog isn’t a highlight reel. It’s mostly notes from building things that had to survive contact with reality. Some posts will be about systems. Some will probably be about mistakes. A few might age poorly. That’s fine.

I’m writing as I go.

(# of future rewrites of this intro: probably more than I think)
