Realtime co-pilots are now fully supported across mobile and desktop clients, enabling consistent workflows regardless of device. The core change is a shared streaming protocol that keeps state in sync without sacrificing responsiveness.

## What changed

- Unified streaming transport for mobile + desktop.
- Latency budgets enforced at the edge.
- Shared UI primitives for inline guidance.

## Why it matters

Teams can deliver the same co-pilot experience everywhere, without branching feature development for each platform.
