# Multimodal agents reach production with a new orchestration layer.

Teams are finally shipping multimodal agents in production thanks to a thin orchestration layer that standardizes routing, memory, and tool execution. Early adopters report higher reliability, faster iteration, and clearer debugging pathways.

## Highlights

- A single event stream for text, vision, and audio.
- Declarative routing rules for tool selection.
- Shared evaluation hooks across every step.

## What this enables

Organizations can now roll out production agents without building bespoke infrastructure for each use case. The orchestration layer becomes the backbone for new features and reduces long-term maintenance.
