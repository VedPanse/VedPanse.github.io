A human-centered evaluation framework is raising the bar for AI product quality by balancing quantitative metrics with direct user assessment. This has led to more reliable launches and fewer regressions.

## What the framework adds

- Human review embedded in the evaluation loop.
- Shared qualitative scorecards.
- Consistent taxonomy for user feedback.

## Why teams are adopting it

It bridges the gap between automated metrics and real user impact, which is essential for trust.
