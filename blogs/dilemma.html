        <h1>Basics First</h1>
        <p>Before making an entry into computers by learning programming languages, you should have a strong base about
            how computers work. This knowledge will not only help you in your future projects, but will also help you
            understand the interaction between programming languages and the Operating System. Having general knowledge
            about the terminal, for example, will help to dive deeper into execution of code.</p>
        <br><br>


        <h1>Choosing a language</h1>
        <p>Choosing a programming language has become difficult in the present day world, since a large number of them
            are available readily. While each of them is better than the other in its unique way, it may not necessarily
            mean that they are equally easy to learn. Python and JavaScript are usually opted by people for starting
            their programming journey.<br><br>I suggest that you must start with mark-up languages like HTML, CSS and
            JS. After
            mastering them, proceeding towards learning Python is a good choice. If Python isn't enough to quench your
            thirst, and you want to learn even more programming languages, Kotlin is a good option because of its
            Cross-Platform feature.</p><br><br>

        <h1>Staying productive</h1>
        <p>After mastering at least one programming language, I suggest you to begin with solving problems that were
            asked in job interviews. I personally tried this, and believe me, I was able to learn and understand many
            new concepts. It is a whole different kind of exposure. When you solve one problem, you get instant
            motivation to move on to the other. Thus, you gain self confidence. But if you get stuck anywhere, you might
            get frustrated. This is what often happened to me.<br><br>
            So, all I did was take a break. In this break, I allowed my mind to refresh itself. I used to study in my
            break, because I was in school when I started programming (and I obviously did not want to lag behind in
            there). After a couple of days, or maybe weeks, I used to come back to programming with a fresh mind. It was
            only then when I could solve the hard problems without any frustration.</p><br><br>

        <h1>Communities</h1>
        <p>You can also join popular communities like StackOverflow and GitHub to ask your questions to programmers of
            the world, and also answer their questions. This is a promising opportunity for you to expand your knowledge
            over a particular topic, and staying up-to-date with the news and trends.<br><br>So, this is it for this
            blog. Stay healthy, stay safe, and exercise your programming skills daily. All the best!</p>
