            <p>I was an intern at Findability Sciences, Aurangabad. This blog narrates my experience and all I got
                to learn there.</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Findability Sciences (FS) is a leading enterprise artificial intelligence company that operates in the
                United States of America, India, and Japan. I was an intern at FS from 25th April to 25th May. Besides
                meeting the awesome staff, I had a wonderful time learning there. I entered the office on the first day
                with my eyes shining, excited to know more about my favorite subject. On the last day, I returned home
                with more interest and curiosity about the topic.</p><br>

            <h3>My Assignments</h3>
            <p>Mr. Mandar Kulkarni was my supervisor. My first task was to prepare an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on
                an initiative by the Government of Maharashtra. It discussed how Defense and Aerospace Engineering
                departments in Maharashtra could incorporate Artificial Intelligence (AI). I was bouncing from one desk
                to another, talking with the staff, and hoping to camouflage in the corporate environment.</p>
            <div class="quote">
                <p>I felt like the spring festivals had begun - I had an infinite source of knowledge waiting - just
                    that
                    month.</p>
            </div>
            <p>For my second assignment, Mr. Shravan Inamdar supervised me. This time, I had to work with real-time data
                for one of our clients, who were from a big real-estate corporate. My task was to prepare reports on the
                real-estate conditions in several Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in the U.S. By the end of the
                week, I had completed 4 reports about 26 MSAs. Mr. Shravan Inamdar was very impressed by my speed.</p>
            <div class="quote">
                <p>Initially, I was confused as I did not see any link connecting machine learning and report writing.
                    But
                    as I progressed, I understood that such reports make up about 20% of machine learning. Interesting,
                    isn't it?</p>
            </div>
            <p>Next, it was time to learn something new: the basics of the coding part of machine learning. I have made
                separate documentation of <a href="../docs/machine-learning/index.html">everything I learned there</a>.
            </p>
            <p>My other tasks included plotting graphs and sending them for presentations to clients. I could also add
                my learnings to my technical blog called <a href="../TheArchive/index.html">The Techies</a>.</p>
            <p>This internship opened up a new dimension for me. It was a dimension that changed my outlook toward AI as
                something more than a career - it was a passion. I was quick to accept this passion, all thanks to the
                wonderful team.</p><br>
            <p>In the end, I would like to express my gratitude to Findability Sciences, Mr. Suresh Shakkarwar, Mr.
                Mandar Kulkarni, and Mr. Shravan Inamdar for helping me to gain valuable insights about my 'aspiring'
                career. Their guidance also helped me witness a corporate environment. I would also like to thank Mr.
                Gajanan for serving me delicious lemonade and keeping me hydrated.</p>
