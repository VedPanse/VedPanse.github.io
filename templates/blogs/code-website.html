    <h1>Why do I code all of my websites without any tools?</h1>
    <p>If the curious ones among you ever hit inspect element on any of the websites that I built, you would have
        noticed that I do not use any website builder services like Wix or WordPress. Instead, I have written all my
        websites using HTML and CSS and added dynamic components using JavaScript..</p>
    <br>
    <p>Although it cost me a lot of time and effort to get all the components aligned and designed, I believe it was
        worth it. I enjoy long hours of typing frantically on my keyboard and hitting the reload button to see the
        changes reflected on the website. Other than that, I also enjoy the freedom that comes with coding sites:-</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can tailor the design to your expectations without making any compromises.</li>
        <li>You can change the elements locally without visiting the builderâ€™s website.</li>
        <li>You can also introduce major updates, like pushing a blog to the website, easily with a self-coded
            website.
        </li>
        <li>And above all, you learn many valuable skills in web development. Implementing these skills regularly would
            keep you in touch with the latest updates in the field, potentially providing a breakthrough in your career.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <b>While learning web development</b>
    <p>So far, I have enjoyed the freedom to design the various projects I have engaged in and the practice I have put
        myself through. Back in high school, when I was almost addicted to designing webpages, I used to ferret around
        on <a href="https://pinterest.com" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> for design inspiration. In those days, my goal was to upgrade my web development skills to such
        a level that I could replicate any website to the finest detail. I would then push my website designs to
        <a href="https://codepen.io/VedPanse" target="_blank">CodePen</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <b>Conclusion</b>
    <p>Now that I am very close to achieving my goal of fine-tuning my skills, I find self-coding websites more
        appealing than using website builder services. Looking back, had I started my journey by using builder services,
        I would have missed the fun that is bound to coding. I am glad that I made learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript an
        integral part of my learning and career journey.</p>
