    <h1>Why do I code all of my websites without any tools?</h1>    <div id="about-monger">
        <p>Ved Panse • 30 December, 2024</p>
    </div>

    <p>If the curious ones among you ever hit inspect element on any of the websites that I built, you would have
        noticed that I do not use any website builder services like Wix or WordPress. Instead, I have written all my
        websites using HTML and CSS and added dynamic components using JavaScript.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Although it cost me a lot of time and effort to get all the components aligned and designed, I believe it was
        worth it. I enjoy long hours of typing frantically on my keyboard and hitting the reload button to see the
        changes reflected on the website. Other than that, I also enjoy the freedom that comes with coding sites:-</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can tailor the design to your expectations without making any compromises.</li>
        <li>You can change the elements locally without visiting the builder’s website.</li>
        <li>You can also introduce major updates, like pushing a blog to the website, easily with a self-coded
            website.
        </li>
        <li>And above all, you learn many valuable skills in web development. Implementing these skills regularly would
            keep you in touch with the latest updates in the field, potentially providing a breakthrough in your career.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <b>While learning web development</b>
    <p>So far, I have enjoyed the freedom to design the various projects I have engaged in and the practice I have put
        myself through. Back in high school, when I was almost addicted to designing webpages, I used to ferret around
        on <a href="https://pinterest.com" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> for design inspiration. In those days, my goal
        was to upgrade my web development skills to such
        a level that I could replicate any website to the finest detail. I would then push my website designs to
        <a href="https://codepen.io/VedPanse" target="_blank">CodePen</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <b>Conclusion</b>
    <p>Now that I am very close to achieving my goal of fine-tuning my skills, I find self-coding websites more
        appealing than using website builder services. Looking back, had I started my journey by using builder services,
        I would have missed the fun that now binds me to web development. It also inspired me to learn different
        programming languages and implement web development to create Graphical User Interfaces (through SpringBoot
        in Java and Flask in Python).</p>
    <br>
    <p>I am glad that I made learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript an
        integral part of my learning and career journey.</p>
