        <h1>Switching to the Vim Editing Mode Altogether</h1>    <div id="about-monger">
        <p>Ved Panse â€¢ 3 March, 2020</p>
    </div>
        <p>For a long time, I have been sitting beside my dad, watching him code software all day while I switched
            between studying and working on personal projects. One day, I noticed that he had changed the way he typed.
            He pressed a sequence of seemingly random keys without using the mouse, and the text on his code editor
            would change. He could make large-scale text manipulations so quickly that it piqued my curiosity. I asked
            him what he was using, and he told me about <a href="https://www.vim.org" target="blank">Vim Editing</a> and
            sent me an instructional course on YouTube.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Although I never found the time to watch those videos until the summer break after my freshman year of
            college, learning this tool has completely transformed my typing skills. Vim stands for Vi Improved. Vi is a
            text editor used to perform similar large-scale manipulations using only a keyboard. Vim introduced several
            important features like window splitting, code highlighting, macros, and pattern matching, making it more
            user-friendly than Vi for beginners.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I rarely use the trackpad or my mouse now, yet I can travel seamlessly through the document buffer. I must
            admit that it took me more than three days to get used to Vim, but once I mastered the shortcuts from this
            cheatsheet, it wasn't long until I downloaded Vim plugins for all my code editors.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I found the register command the most interesting. It helps me record my repetitive actions, which are
            usually a combination of shorter actions, and execute them with a single command. So far, I am only halfway
            through learning the multitude of shortcuts Vim offers. I can't wait to learn more.</p>
        <br>
