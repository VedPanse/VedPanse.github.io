  <p>
    If you're reading this, you're either extremely bored or impressively curious — either way, welcome.
    I’m Ved Panse, a sophomore at UC San Diego, majoring in Mathematics–Computer Science.
    Most days, I oscillate between abstract problem solving and building real systems — a duality that keeps things interesting and occasionally causes harmless existential spirals at 2 AM.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was born in Thousand Oaks, California, and raised in Aurangabad, India — which means my syntax is mostly clean, but my food is unapologetically spicy. Growing up across cultures gave me a unique lens on the world: structured when needed, creative when possible, and always asking “what if we built this better?”
  </p>

  <p>
    My interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence, system design, and human experience. I’ve worked on projects ranging from memory-driven conversational bots to real-time avionics simulations to web platforms that make complex data approachable. Whether I’m designing an interface or fine-tuning a model, I’m drawn to systems that are both technically sound and intuitively usable.
  </p>

  <p>
    This blog isn’t a polished portfolio — it’s more of a working journal. A place to document what I’ve learned (and unlearned), where I’ve succeeded, where I’ve hit walls, and occasionally, where I’ve been pleasantly surprised. I might share thoughts on building multi-modal assistants, lessons from debugging strange edge cases, or why certain problems just feel more elegant when solved recursively.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you’re into clean design, clever engineering, or just want a peek into how a young developer thinks in a world of LLMs and infinite Git branches — you’re in the right place. And if something here sparks a thought or a question, feel free to <a href="../../index.html#contact" target="_blank">drop me a message</a>. 
    I promise not to respond with an auto-generated reply (unless I'm prototyping that too).
  </p>
