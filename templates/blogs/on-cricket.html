        <h1>On Cricket — A Cultural Constant</h1>

        <p>
            Cricket was never introduced to me — it simply existed, like ceiling fans and monsoons. In India, you don’t
            “get into” cricket. You absorb it.
            It’s ambient. It’s structural. It’s the one thing that can unite a tea vendor and a software architect in a
            three-hour argument over strike rates.
        </p>

        <p>
            The game operates on many levels: national obsession, social equalizer, and occasionally, substitute for
            traffic control.
            At any given moment, in any urban or semi-urban street, there is a non-zero chance that someone is using a
            brick as a stump and calling themselves captain.
        </p>

        <h3>Personal Beginnings</h3>
        <p>
            I first got pulled into cricket during an evening walk with my grandfather — a group of kids were playing
            nearby, and I stayed.
            Not for five minutes. For the rest of the evening. That moment turned into a habit. For a while, any flat
            surface and spherical object in the house were considered fair game.
            Guests had a higher-than-average chance of being greeted with a casual underarm delivery.
        </p>

        <p>
            In school, I was an opening batsman — aggressive, occasionally effective, and perpetually convinced that the
            opposing fielders were standing in the wrong place.
            Most of my reputation was built in tennis-ball circuits, where bounce is unpredictable and rules are
            enforced with the democratic efficiency of shouting.
        </p>

        <h3>The Broader View</h3>
        <p>
            Over time, my engagement with the game shifted from participation to observation. I don’t play competitively
            anymore, but I follow the sport closely — with the practiced cynicism of someone who’s lived through
            multiple ICC knockout campaigns.
            Like many, I’ve come to appreciate the finer details: field placements, bowling variations, and the
            physics-defying confidence of batters trying to reverse scoop at 150 km/h.
        </p>

        <p>
            Cricket remains a fixture — not in a nostalgic sense, but in a cultural one. It’s a game that offers
            everything from tactical depth to spontaneous absurdity.
            It’s where a tailender can become a national hero for scoring seven not out, and where millions will pause
            their day to argue about whether that edge carried.
        </p>

        <p>
            I no longer play every day. I don’t bring a bat to family gatherings. But when the first ball of a match is
            bowled and the commentary team clears their throats — something still clicks into place.
        </p>
