                <p class="main">On December 12, 2021, the WH-Leo Club volunteered to spread warmth in the winter of 2021 by donating warm clothes to landless people.</p><br><br><br>


                <h3>Our Aim</h3>
                <p>The WH-Leo Club is on a mission of the general public benefit. Our aim for the 'Spread Warmth' initiative was to provide warmth to landless people in the catastrophic winter cold. This initiative would also help to make the landless people's
                    Christmas a memorable one.</p>
                <br><br><br>

                <h3>Our Banner</h3>
                <p>To attract attention towards our donation drive, we started creating various advertising forms and banners.<br>
                    <img src="../../images/Spread Warmth.jpeg"><br><br>The circulation of this banner helped us earn more than 50% of our donations. After the advertising was done, we were all set to donate the collected clothes to the landless.</p><br><br><br>

                <h3>Carrying out the activities</h3>
                <p>
                    After mastering at least one programming language, I suggest you to begin with solving problems that were asked in job interviews. I personally tried this, and believe me, I was able to learn and understand many new concepts. It is a whole different kind
                    of exposure. When you solve one problem, you get instant motivation to move on to the other. Thus, you gain self confidence. But if you get stuck anywhere, you might get frustrated. This is what often happened to me.<br><br>So,
                    all I did was take a break. In this break, I allowed my mind to refresh itself. I used to study in my break, because I was in school when I started programming (and I obviously did not want to lag behind in there). After a couple of
                    days, or maybe weeks, I used to come back to programming with a fresh mind. It was only then when I could solve the hard problems without any frustration.
                </p><br><br><br>
                <h3>Epilogue</h3>
                <p>
                    You can also join popular communities like StackOverflow and GitHub to ask your questions to programmers of the world, and also answer their questions. This is a promising opportunity for you to expand your knowledge over a particular topic, and staying
                    up-to-date with the news and trends.
